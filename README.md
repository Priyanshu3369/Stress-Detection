# Stress Detection Model

🎯 This repository contains a machine learning-based stress detection model that analyzes input data to classify the stress levels of individuals. The model leverages a Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier to identify stress patterns based on features extracted from the dataset.

## ✨ Features
- **🧠 Model Type**: Bernoulli Naive Bayes
- **📊 Input Data**: Custom dataset with stress-related features
- **🎯 Output**: Stress classification (e.g., "Stressed" or "Not Stressed")
- **🛠️ Custom Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and feature extraction pipeline
